# Vector Mathematics Toolkit
#### Description: :
The Vector Mathematics Toolkit is designed to facilitate complex vector operations for academic, scientific, and engineering purposes. With an intuitive interface and an extensive set of functions, it caters to students, educators, and professionals in fields that frequently engage with vector mathematics, such as physics, computer science, and engineering.

## Key Features
#### Dot Product Calculation:
Computes the dot product, reflecting the cosine of the angle between two vectors and their magnitude.
#### Cross Product Calculation:
Determines the cross product, yielding a vector orthogonal to the initial vector plane.
#### Angle Calculation:
Measures the angle between vectors in both degrees and radians.
#### Magnitude Calculation:
Finds the length or magnitude of a given vector.
#### Vector Addition/Subtraction:
Performs addition or subtraction of two vectors.
#### Scalar Multiplication:
Scales a vector by a given scalar value.
#### Vector Projection:
Projects one vector onto another, identifying the component of one vector along the direction of the other.
#### Orthogonality Check:
Tests whether two vectors are orthogonal (i.e., perpendicular).
#### Unit Vector Calculation:
Normalizes a vector to produce a unit vector in the same direction.
#### Area of Parallelogram:
Computes the area of the parallelogram spanned by two vectors.
#### Volume of Parallelepiped:
Calculates the volume of the parallelepiped defined by three vectors.
#### Interactive Command-Line Interface:
Offers an interactive menu to select and perform multiple vector operations in one session.
## How It Works
Upon execution, the toolkit prompts the user through a command-line interface to select one or multiple vector operations. Users can input vector components directly, and the program computes the desired results in a clear, readable format. For more complex tasks, multiple operations can be queued and processed at once, enhancing productivity and workflow.


## Testing and Reliability
Included in the project is a test_project.py script that utilizes Python’s unittest framework to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the toolkit’s functions. Each vector operation has associated test cases that validate the correctness of the outcomes, ensuring the toolkit performs as expected.
